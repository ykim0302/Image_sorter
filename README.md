This is an image sorter which renames images in a given folder into the earliest dates chosen from the dates when images were taken, modified, or created.

The code can be modified to sort any type of files, and not just images.
Also, it can be modified to be more specific and accurate by including times, and not just dates.


The reason I wrote this code:
  I had about 500 photos taken with me and my girlfriend, and I wanted to put them all in a video to celebrate our anniversary.
  First I had to sort the photos because I wanted to put them in a video in order of dates.
  But the built-in function in the File Explorer was not very accurate. Some images had different "taken time" and "created time" and some of them did not have "taken     time". They got all mixed up everytime I try to sort them using the File Explorer.
  At that time, I renamed them all one by one by putting in 8 digit dates in front of the file name using my memories, and some date datas provided.
  This took me about 3 to 4 hours by hand.
  
Then, I taught myself Python and I thought maybe I could use this to reduce the time it takes to sorting images in a big scale.
So, I wrote this code and now it only takes seconds to rename and sort them by dates.
